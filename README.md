Claude Code will happily burn your entire 5-hour window while you're at lunch.
Sessions pile up, agents spawn agents, a server grinds all night — and the
first you hear is **"limit reached, resets at 03:00."**

Redline already knows. It was watching.

## Three faces, one daemon

A tiny background daemon (`ccwatchd`) tails `~/.claude`, computes rates, alerts
and the Governor, and serves it over a local socket. On top of that sit **three
views** — use whichever you like, together or alone.

### 🍎 Menu bar

![Redline menu bar](docs/screenshot-menubar.svg)

The menu-bar icon is a **live burn-rate graph**, colored by how hard you're
pushing your limit. Click it for a popover:

- **The Governor** up top — throttle (`▲2.1×` / `▼0.4×`), which limit is
  binding, 5h and weekly **%**, both **reset times**, and a plain-language
  projection: *"weekly tokens gone: Wed Jul 8, 14:00"* (red if you're on track
  to hit it before it resets).
- **Actively-working sessions** — each a card you expand in place: model,
  tokens, cpu/ram, current action, and its **active subagents** (with their
  task + live rate). **Kill / Pause / Resume** on any of them.
- **⚙ Settings** — two independent knobs: **Limit** (what the number *is*:
  `5h` / `Weekly` / `Mix`, where Mix is whichever wall binds first) and
  **Menu bar shows** (the format: throttle / % / rate / nothing). Plus
  **Start with menu bar only** and **Start at login**.
- Footer buttons: **TUI** (opens the terminal view) and **Dashboard**.

### 🪟 Dashboard window

![Redline dashboard window](docs/screenshot-gui.svg)

A native vibrancy window (SwiftUI). The **Governor** as a live ring for the
binding limit, a **both-limits card** with reset times + "hits ~… at this
pace", the **model mix**, and the fleet totals. Below, a **click-anywhere-to-
expand** list of every session revealing everything it's doing:

**actions** · **active agents** (nested, with model + burn) · **tasks** ·
**child processes** · **watchers** — plus Kill/Pause/Resume.

**Hide inactive** / **Hide done** filter the list. The Dock icon appears
**only while the window is open**; close it and Redline lives in the menu bar.

### 🖥 Terminal UI

![Redline terminal UI](docs/screenshot-tui.svg)

The whole fleet in your terminal — burn, tokens, cpu/ram, activity, agents,
alerts. Run `ccwatch`, or hit **TUI** in the menu-bar popover.

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` jump anywhere | `d` details | `s` sort | `enter` expand |
| `k` kill | `p` `r` pause/resume | `f` hide idle | `x` hide done |

## The Governor

A fuel gauge for your real plan limits — both the 5-hour window *and* the weekly
cap. With the [browser extension](#-browser-extension-usage-bridge) it reads your
**exact** usage % straight from claude.ai, so the gauge matches Claude to the
percent. Without it, Redline anchors to any usage markers Claude Code writes into
its transcripts, and otherwise learns the ceiling from your own 429 walls.
Self-correcting, zero config, nothing to calibrate.

A glance looks like this:

```
5h 40% · weekly 54% · 16 active · 8.1k tok/min · ▲1.9× (weekly binding)
```

The number that matters is the **throttle**. The rule is dead simple:

- `▼0.4×` — **you're good**, you'll coast to the reset. Push more if you want.
- `▲1.9×` — you're burning fast enough to **hit the wall early** — ease off, or
  switch to a cheaper model / fewer agents.

- It always shows the **binding** limit — whichever wall you'll hit first (`▲2.1×`
  = 2.1× the pace that coasts you to reset).
- It **projects when** you'll hit that wall at the current pace — *"weekly tokens
  gone: Wed 14:00"* — so you can decide which models to use and how many agents
  to run *before* you get surprised mid-task.
- Usage is metered in **Opus-equivalent tokens**, weighted per model, so the
  gauge stays honest across a Fable/Opus/Sonnet mix.
- Limit math counts **billable** tokens (input + output + cache-creation —
  what Anthropic's limits count); the per-session **burn rate you see is the
  actual work** (input + output), so it isn't drowned out by cache churn.

## What else it tracks

- 🖥 **Fleet view** — all sessions, all machines: burn, tokens, cpu/ram, last
  activity, the same titles Claude's UI uses.
- 🔍 **Live activity** — `✎ Edit engine.rs` · `⚙ cargo build 87%` — in-flight
  tool calls *and* real child processes, per session.
- 🤖 **Agents** — who spawned what, nested, with truthful running/done state.
  Even nested subagents (workflow-spawned, in git worktrees) get their tokens
  attributed and show as **active** while they burn.
- 🚨 **Leak alerts** — runaway loops, cache bleed, agent storms, sessions
  burning while "idle", servers gone dark.
- 🔪 **Kill switch** — kill / pause / resume from any surface, with confirmation.
- 🛰 **Remote machines, zero install** — one line of JSON; a python probe rides
  over ssh, nothing gets installed.

## Install

Grab the [**latest release**](https://github.com/jagajaga/redline/releases/latest).
Every release is a **universal** build (Apple Silicon + Intel) and ships:

| Asset | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Redline-*.dmg` | the macOS app — drag-to-`/Applications` installer |
| `Redline-*.zip` | the same `Redline.app`, zipped (if you prefer) |
| `ccwatch-*-macos-universal.tar.gz` | the terminal UI + daemon (`ccwatch`, `ccwatchd`) |
| `redline-usage-bridge-firefox-*.xpi` | the Firefox add-on (signed) — feeds the Governor exact usage % |
| `redline-usage-bridge-chrome-*.zip` | the Chrome / Chromium extension — same, load unpacked |
| `checksums.txt` | SHA-256 of every asset |

### The macOS app (menu bar + dashboard window)

Native SwiftUI, **macOS 14+**. Open `Redline-*.dmg` and drag **Redline.app** into
**Applications**. It opens the dashboard window by default and lives in the menu
bar (`ccwatchd` + the TUI ride along inside the bundle — nothing else to install).

The app is unsigned, so the **first launch** needs a right-click → **Open** →
**Open**, or:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Redline.app
```

Then flip **Start with menu bar only** to launch tray-only, and **Start at login**
to keep it there.

### Terminal UI only

```sh
tar xzf ccwatch-*-macos-universal.tar.gz
mv ccwatch/ccwatch ccwatch/ccwatchd /usr/local/bin/   # or anywhere on PATH
ccwatch
```

### 🧩 Browser extension (Usage Bridge)

Claude's exact usage % lives behind Cloudflare, so a background app can't read
it. The **Usage Bridge** runs inside your logged-in browser — the clean way past
it — reads your 5-hour and weekly percentages from claude.ai and forwards them to
the local daemon on `127.0.0.1`. **No credentials are stored, nothing leaves your
machine**, and the Governor then matches Claude to the percent.

- **Firefox** — open `redline-usage-bridge-firefox-*.xpi` (signed, self-distributed).
- **Chrome / Chromium** — unzip `redline-usage-bridge-chrome-*.zip`, then
  `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked**.

### From source

```sh
cargo build --release && ./target/release/ccwatch   # daemon + TUI (Rust)
swift build -c release --package-path app            # the macOS app (Swift)
```

No setup. No accounts. No telemetry. The daemon starts itself and exits when the
last client disconnects.

## Remote machines

```json
// ~/.claude/ccwatch/remotes.json
[{ "name": "my-server", "kind": "ssh", "target": "user@host" }]
```

Needs ssh keys and python3 on the box. That's the whole setup. Remote sessions
land in the same views, killable over ssh, and a dead server becomes an alert —
not a silent gap.

## Tune

Everything is optional — Redline learns budgets from the wall. Budgets are in
**Opus-equivalent** tokens (Opus ×1, Fable ×2, Sonnet ×0.6, Haiku ×0.2) so a
tank stays honest as the mix shifts.

```toml
# ~/.claude/ccwatch/config.toml — all optional
#window_budget = 200_000_000  # 5h plan window; unset → learned from 429s
#week_budget   = 600_000_000  # weekly cap; unset → learned from limit markers
#weight_fable  = 2.0          # override a model weight if pricing shifts
terminal = "iTerm"            # terminal for the TUI button
burn_tokens_per_min = 40000   # where the menu-bar graph turns red
```

## Under the hood

```
~/.claude  ──┐   browser ext ──┐    ┌── ssh ── remote ~/.claude
             ▼   (127.0.0.1)   ▼    ▼
          ccwatchd ── tails transcripts (new bytes only), watches pids,
             │        exact usage % from the extension, computes rates ·
             │        alerts · the Governor
             ├────────────────┐   unix socket, JSON snapshots
             ▼                ▼
        ccwatch (TUI)   Redline.app (menu bar + dashboard window, SwiftUI)
```

Claude Code already writes everything worth knowing into `~/.claude`. Redline
just reads it well. Idle cost: ~0% CPU.
